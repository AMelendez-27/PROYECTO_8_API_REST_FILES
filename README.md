# PROJECT 8: API REST Files
## _thePower - Full Stack Development_

## Description
This is one of the latest projects I completed to obtain the backend developer certification. The goal was to apply everything I had learned about uploading, transforming, and deleting files in a cloud environment â€” in this case, Cloudinary. For the database, I used MongoDB, as in previous projects.

---

## Project Requirements
- Server with express  
- Connection to a Mongo Atlas database using mongoose  
- Creation of two models, both with a field that allows us to store a file  
- A seed to upload data to one of the collections  
- A relationship between collections  
- Full CRUD for all collections  
- README with project documentation, listing the endpoints and what each one does  
- File uploads via Cloudinary to both collections  
- File deletion in Cloudinary when the entry is removed from the DB  
- Attempt to reuse Cloudinary storage by changing the folder (may be commented out)

## Tech
- Node.js
- Express
- Mongoose
- MongoDB Atlas
- DotEnv
- Multer
- Cloudinary

## Installation
This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20.10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and run the server:

```sh
cd PROYECTO_8_API_REST_FILES
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create a `.env` file in the root with your MongoDB and Cloudinary credentials:
```
DB_URL=your_mongodb_url
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```
